## Quick Start

### Ballistic Calculator
Visit the [Ballistic Calculator](https://www.ballisticstoolkit.com/ballistic-calc/ballistic-calc.html) and enter your:

1. **Bullet specs** - Weight, diameter, BC, drag function
2. **Conditions** - Temperature, pressure, humidity, altitude  
3. **Wind** - Speed and direction using 12-hour clock (12=tailwind, 3=right crosswind, 6=headwind, 9=left crosswind)
4. **Shot data** - Muzzle velocity, zero range, scope height

Results display drop and drift corrections in your choice of milliradians or MOA for precise long-range adjustments.

### Target Simulator
Navigate to the [Target Simulator](https://www.ballisticstoolkit.com/target-sim/target-sim.html) for match simulation:

1. **Bullet Parameters** - BC, muzzle velocity, diameter, drag function
2. **Match Setup** - Target selection, range, shots per match, number of matches
3. **Variability** - MV standard deviation, wind variability, rifle accuracy
4. **Environment** - Altitude, temperature, humidity, pressure

Watch realistic shot impacts on NRA targets with detailed logging and statistical analysis.

### F-Class Simulator
Visit the [F-Class Simulator](https://www.ballisticstoolkit.com/fclass-sim/fclass-sim.html):

1. **Pick Distance** (300‚Äì1000 yds) and wind preset (default: Vortex)
2. **Set Ballistics** (BC, MV, diameter, accuracy; G7 recommended)
3. **Scopes** (spotting: WASD/EQ; rifle: arrows/¬±)
4. **Match Flow** (Relay 1 sighters until ‚ÄúGo For Record‚Äù; Relays 2‚Äì3: 2 sighters)
5. **Shoot & Score** (per‚Äërelay HUD, scorecard modal)

Tip: Use mirage + flags together. Mirage leans with crosswind and increases with zoom.

## Building from Source

Requires Emscripten SDK, CMake ‚â• 3.16, and Python 3 (Web Server).

```bash
# Install Emscripten
git clone https://github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk.git
cd emsdk
./emsdk install latest
./emsdk activate latest
source ./emsdk_env.sh

# Build
cd BallisticsToolkit
./build_web.sh
```

Opens local server at http://localhost:8001

## Technical Details

- **Engine**: 3DOF ballistics simulation with 2nd-order Runge-Kutta (RK2) midpoint method
- **Language**: C++17 compiled to WebAssembly with Emscripten
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript with modern CSS, no frameworks
- **Units**: SI base units internally with conversion utilities for user-friendly I/O
- **Performance**: Optimized C++ core with direct vector operations
- **Wind Module**: `WindGenerator` class (C++) implements a 2D curl field sampled from Simplex noise (x, y, t) with multi‚Äëoctave components (strength, spatial/temporal scales, exponent reshaping, optional sigmoid gating). Uses RMS normalization (one-time initialization from 1000 samples) for stable magnitude distribution, global advection (unified pattern movement), and clipping at 2x strength to prevent unrealistic wind speeds
- **Match Scoring**: Complete NRA scoring system with statistical analysis
- **Deployment**: GitHub Actions auto-deploys to GitHub Pages
- **Architecture**: Client-side only, no server required
