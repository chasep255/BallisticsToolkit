        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>1. Agreement to the Terms</h2>
            <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") form a legally binding agreement between you (the User) and the Ballistics Toolkit site owner (the "maintainer," "I," or "me"). By accessing or using the Ballistics Toolkit website and its static tools (collectively, the "Services"), you acknowledge that you have read and understood these Terms and that continued use signifies your acceptance.</p>
            <p>If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not use the Services. If you use the Services on behalf of an organization, you represent that you have authority to bind that organization.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>2. Purpose of the Services</h2>
            <p><strong>Educational/informational use only:</strong> Ballistics Toolkit is a static, non‑commercial website that provides ballistics calculators and simulators for recreational, educational and informational purposes.</p>
            <p>The Services use theoretical models and simulations that may not reflect real‑world conditions. They are not a substitute for professional training or safety advice. You are solely responsible for compliance with local firearms laws and safe handling practices.</p>

            <h3 style="color: #856404; margin-top: 15px;">Firearm Safety Disclaimer</h3>
            <p><strong>BallisticsToolkit.com does NOT provide safety-validated firing data.</strong></p>
            <p>Do NOT rely on these simulations for setting real-world dope, live-fire decisions, or for evaluating safe firearm configurations.</p>
            <p>Firearm use is inherently dangerous. Always follow manufacturer instructions and standard firearm safety rules.</p>
            
            <h3 style="color: #856404; margin-top: 15px;">Reloading / Handloading Warning</h3>
            <p><strong>Reloading can be hazardous.</strong> Always follow published load data from component manufacturers.</p>
            <p>Never attempt to derive load data from BallisticsToolkit.com simulations.</p>
            
            <h3 style="color: #856404; margin-top: 15px;">Accuracy Limitations</h3>
            <p>All ballistic paths, wind drift values, and drop tables are theoretical and may differ substantially from real-world results.</p>
            <p>No guarantee of correctness, precision, or suitability is made.</p>
