            <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
            <p>These Terms of Service (&ldquo;Terms&rdquo;) are a binding agreement between you (&ldquo;User&rdquo;) and the owner of BallisticsToolkit.com (&ldquo;I,&rdquo; &ldquo;me,&rdquo; or &ldquo;the maintainer&rdquo;).</p>
            <p>By accessing or using Ballistics Toolkit (the &ldquo;Services&rdquo;), you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to these Terms.</p>
            <p>If you do not agree, do not use the Services. If you use the Services on behalf of an organization, you represent that you have authority to bind that organization.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>2. Description and Purpose of the Services</h2>
            <p>Ballistics Toolkit is a free, static, non‑commercial, and educational/informational website that provides various tools and simulations related to external ballistics.</p>
            <p>This includes (but is not limited to) trajectory calculators, load comparison tools, statistical simulations, and interactive shooting simulators.</p>
            <p>All models, outputs, graphics, and simulations produced by the Services are theoretical and are not validated for real-world decision-making. The Services are designed for learning, experimentation, and recreational simulation, not operational use.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="content-section" style="background: #fff3cd; border-left: 4px solid #ffc107; padding: 20px; margin: 20px 0;">
            <h2 style="color: #856404; margin-top: 0;">⚠️ 3. Safety, Real-World Use, and Accuracy Disclaimers</h2>
            
            <h3 style="color: #856404; margin-top: 15px;">3.1 Real-World Use</h3>
            <p>Some users may choose to apply ballistic outputs from the Services in real-world shooting. If you do so:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>No guarantee is made regarding the accuracy, precision, safety, or suitability of any output.</li>
                <li>You must not rely on the Services in any situation where incorrect results could be unsafe or hazardous.</li>
                <li>All real-world use must be independently verified through safe, responsible live-fire testing.</li>
                <li>You assume all risk associated with any real-world application of the Services.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3 style="color: #856404; margin-top: 15px;">3.2 Firearm Safety</h3>
            <p><strong>BallisticsToolkit.com does NOT provide safety-validated firing data, verified dope, or guidance on safe firearm configurations.</strong></p>
            <p>You must not use the Services to determine safe firing solutions, maximum or minimum charges, dangerous or safe conditions, pressure limits, stability margins, or any internal ballistics behavior.</p>
            <p>Firearm use is inherently dangerous. Always follow manufacturer instructions and standard firearm safety rules.</p>
            
            <h3 style="color: #856404; margin-top: 15px;">3.3 Reloading / Handloading Warning</h3>
            <p>The Services model external ballistics only. They do not calculate pressure, powder behavior, burn rate, or any internal ballistics properties.</p>
            <p>The Services must not be used to create, derive, or validate load data. Always rely on published load data from component or powder manufacturers.</p>
            
            <h3 style="color: #856404; margin-top: 15px;">3.4 Modeling and Accuracy Limitations</h3>
            <p>All trajectories, wind effects, drift values, stability estimates, simulations, animations, statistical results, and visual outputs are approximations subject to factors such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Environmental variability</li>
                <li>Ammunition and firearm differences</li>
                <li>Measurement error</li>
                <li>Wind turbulence and uncertainty</li>
                <li>Software bugs, modeling limitations, or numerical instability</li>
            </ul>
            <p>No guarantee of correctness, completeness, or accuracy is made.</p>
            
            <h3 style="color: #856404; margin-top: 15px;">3.5 Not Professional Advice</h3>
            <p>Nothing provided by the Services constitutes ballistic engineering advice, gunsmithing guidance, legal advice, safety recommendations, or a load development methodology.</p>
            
            <h3 style="color: #856404; margin-top: 15px;">3.6 Use at Your Own Risk</h3>
            <p>You assume all risks associated with using the Services, whether for learning, simulation, experimentation, or any real-world application.</p>
