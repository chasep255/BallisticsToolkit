        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect when you use Ballistics Toolkit, how we use and share it, and your choices regarding that information.</p>
            <p>Ballistics Toolkit is a free, non‑commercial, static web application. The site owner does not maintain user accounts, mailing lists, or a server‑side database of personal information.</p>
            <p>By accessing or using the Services, you consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of your information as described here. If you do not agree, please do not use the Services.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>Ballistics Toolkit collects only limited data:</p>
            
            <p><strong>Usage data via Google Analytics:</strong> When you visit the site, we use Google Analytics to collect pseudonymous information such as pages visited, referrer URLs, approximate geographic location based on IP address, device and browser type, and interaction events (e.g., clicks). IP addresses may be anonymized according to your region and Google's settings.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Cookies and local storage:</strong> The site uses essential cookies for core functionality (such as remembering your preferences) and analytics cookies for Google Analytics. We do not use advertising or marketing cookies.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Feedback:</strong> If you voluntarily contact us (for example, by opening an issue on GitHub), we may collect your username and any information you provide. We do not operate contact forms or email subscriptions.</p>
            
            <p>We do not intentionally collect names, mailing addresses, payment details, or other personally identifying information.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>
            <p>We use analytics data to understand how visitors interact with our website, to diagnose technical issues, and to improve functionality.</p>
            <p>We may aggregate and anonymize usage data for statistical or research purposes.</p>
            <p>We do not sell, rent, or trade user information.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>4. Third‑Party Access and Data Sharing</h2>
            <p>Google Analytics is our analytics provider. Google processes information on our behalf to provide aggregated usage statistics. You can learn more in <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google's Privacy Policy</a> and its <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites" target="_blank" rel="noopener">partner‑site policy</a>.</p>
            <p>We may share aggregated, non‑identifiable usage statistics in open‑source project reports.</p>
            <p>We do not otherwise share personal data with third parties.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>5. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
            <p><strong>Essential cookies:</strong> Required for basic operation, such as remembering user preferences for units or simulation options.</p>
            <p><strong>Analytics cookies:</strong> Set by Google Analytics to measure site usage and performance.</p>
            <p><strong>Advertising cookies:</strong> None. We do not serve ads.</p>
            <p>You can disable or delete cookies via your browser settings. For Google Analytics, you can also install the <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Analytics Opt‑out Browser Add‑on</a>.</p>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>6. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
            <p><strong>Access and deletion:</strong> Because we do not maintain user accounts, we cannot identify individual analytics records. If you wish to manage or delete analytics data associated with your device/browser, you may:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Clear your browser's cookies and site data, which removes local identifiers.</li>
                <li>Use Google's privacy tools and the <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Analytics opt‑out add‑on</a> to manage data.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Opt‑out of analytics:</strong> You may install the <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Analytics opt‑out browser add‑on</a> or configure your browser to block cookies.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Children's data:</strong> Our Services are intended for users aged 18 and older. We do not knowingly collect information from children or minors and will delete any such information if discovered.</p>
            
            <p>Privacy laws such as the GDPR or CCPA grant individuals the right to access, correct, or delete personal data. Because we hold no personal data on our servers, we cannot directly fulfill such requests; however, we encourage users to use the methods above to manage their data.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>7. Data Security</h2>
            <p>We use standard security measures (such as HTTPS) to protect data transmitted to and from our site.</p>
            <p>Because we store no user‑identifiable data, risks are limited to the analytics provider. We are not responsible for the security practices of third‑party services.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>8. Data Retention</h2>
            <p>We do not maintain user databases or log files.</p>
            <p>Analytics data is retained by Google Analytics according to its default retention settings; we do not control or shorten these periods.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>9. International Transfers</h2>
            <p>We operate from the United States, but our infrastructure and Google Analytics may process data in multiple jurisdictions. By using the Services, you consent to the transfer of your information across national borders.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>10. Changes to this Policy</h2>
